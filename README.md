Smart Face Detection and Tracking System
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a real-time face detection and tracking system using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. The system includes image collection, data augmentation, model training, and real-time prediction.

Key Features
Image Collection: Uses OpenCV to capture and store images from a webcam.
Data Augmentation: Utilizes Albumentations library for augmenting training images to improve model robustness.
Model Training: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for face detection and bounding box regression.
Real-Time Detection: Applies the trained model to live webcam feed for real-time face detection.

Results
The model effectively detects and tracks faces in real-time, providing bounding boxes around detected faces.
